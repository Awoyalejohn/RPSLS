RPSLS is a game targeted towards people that are interested in playing a challenging game of rock, paper, scissor. 
It has extra hand gestures for  lizard and spock. that lowered the chance of greeting a draw that would typically happen when playing the regular version of the game.

## Testing

- I tested that the game works in different browsers: Chrome, Firefox, and Opera.
- I confirmed that all buttons worked with the intended result when clicked.
- I confirmed that the gameover modal would show after 5 points to win, draw, or lose.
- I confirmed that the header, How to Play, Restart Game and music options, results and footer icons are readable and easy to understand.
- I confirmed that the game is responsive, looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes using devtools device toolbar.

### Bugs

#### Solved bugs
- When I added a way for the hand gestures to display inside of the boxes when a hand gesture button was clicked. The hand gestures would stack on top of each other after every new hand gesture button click. I fixed this by adding a function the would check if there was already a hand gestuer inside the box then stop it from displaying by changing that hand gesture to hidden before the new hand gesture would display.

- I hade a bug where some hand gestures would display outside of the computer hand gesture box when the website was being viewed on larger screens. I fixed this by adding more media queries to postion the hand gesture better inside the computer hand gesture box.
